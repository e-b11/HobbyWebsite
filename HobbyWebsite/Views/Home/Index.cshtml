    <p>I have been drawing for about as long as I can remember. It is something I usually enjoy, unless I have to spend an hour redrawing the same line to get it right. 
        It is also something I wish I had more time for. Below are a few examples of my work.

    <img src="~/img/bobross.jpeg" width="400" alt="Watercolor painting of the sunsetting over mountains and a lake." />
    
    <p>I painted this as an FHE activity, and it was fun since I hadn't painted in a while. 
        It was interesting to recreate a Bob Ross painting with watercolors, since that is not at all the kind of paint that he uses.

    <img src="~/img/jatp.jpeg" width="400" alt="4 members of the band Julie and the Phantoms."/>

    <p>I did this picture a few years ago as part of a fan magazine for a TV show I was obsessed with at the time. 
        The piece was done digitally in procreate, and took at least 15 hours to complete.
